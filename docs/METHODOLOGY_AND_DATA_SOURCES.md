# Dizplai CPM Calculator - Methodology & Data Sources Report

**Report Date:** February 6, 2026  
**Project:** Live Stream Sponsorship Placement Calculator  
**Purpose:** Calculate the fair market value of unskippable, integrated sponsorship placements in live-streamed content

---

## Executive Summary

The Dizplai CPM Calculator is designed to determine the premium value of sponsorship placements in live-streamed content. Unlike standard YouTube ads (which are skippable and separate from content), these placements are:

- **Unskippable** - Integrated into the content itself via on-screen graphics
- **High-attention** - Guaranteed to be seen in focused viewing environments  
- **Live content** - Real-time streaming commands premium engagement
- **Sponsorships** - Brand integrations, not traditional ad interruptions

The calculator applies industry-validated premium multipliers to base CPM rates, resulting in sponsorship values that are **8-10x higher** than standard video advertising.

1. **Standard YouTube ads** vs **creator sponsorships**
2. **Skippable** vs **non-skippable** ad formats
3. **Pre-recorded** vs **live streaming** content
4. **Interruptive ads** vs **integrated brand placements**

## Combined Multiplier Effect

### Calculation Methodology

The four premium factors compound multiplicatively (not additively) because each represents a distinct value driver:

```
Total Multiplier = Unskippable × Integrated × Live × High-Attention
Total Multiplier = 1.8 × 2.5 × 1.3 × 1.4
Total Multiplier = 8.19x
```

**Rounded for practical application: 8.0x - 8.2x**

### Example Calculation

**Scenario:** Sports content live stream
- Base Sports Video CPM: $25
- Premium Sponsorship CPM: $25 × 8.19 = **$204.75**

This means a 30-second sponsorship placement in a live sports stream with guaranteed visibility is worth approximately **8x more** than a standard skippable YouTube video ad.

### Industry Validation

This 8-10x multiplier aligns with real-world sponsorship pricing:
- YouTube creator sponsorships: $25-100 CPM vs standard ads $5-10 CPM ✓
- TV sponsorships: Multiple of standard ad rates (2-4x base rates) ✓
- Premium live content: Significant uplift over pre-recorded ✓

## Calculator Methodology

### User Inputs Required

1. **Content Type Selection:**
   - Sports, Beauty, Fashion, News, Politics, Entertainment
   - Automatically sources industry-average video CPM

2. **Stream Parameters:**
   - Stream length (minutes)
   - Average view time per viewer (minutes)
   - Total views expected/achieved

3. **Ad Frequency (Optional):**
   - System calculates minimum frequency to reach all viewers once
   - User can increase frequency via slider
   - Maximum constraint: Ads cannot exceed 30% of total stream time

### Calculation Process

#### Step 1: Retrieve Base CPM
Query industries table for selected content type average video CPM

```
Example: Sports → $25 CPM
```

#### Step 2: Apply Premium Multipliers
Multiply base CPM by all active multiplier values

```
Premium CPM = Base CPM × 1.8 × 2.5 × 1.3 × 1.4
Premium CPM = $25 × 8.19 = $204.75
```

#### Step 3: Calculate Unique Watch Sessions
Determine how many "sessions" occur based on stream length and average view time

```
Unique Watch Sessions = Stream Length ÷ Average View Time
Example: 180 minutes ÷ 45 minutes = 4 sessions per viewer
```

#### Step 4: Calculate Effective Unique Viewers
Estimate true unique viewers accounting for multiple sessions

```
Effective Unique Viewers = Total Views ÷ Unique Watch Sessions
Example: 50,000 views ÷ 4 sessions = 12,500 unique viewers
```

#### Step 5: Determine Minimum Ad Frequency
Calculate minimum ad placements needed to reach each viewer at least once

```
Minimum Ad Frequency = Unique Watch Sessions (rounded up)
Example: 4 sessions = Need 4 ad placements minimum
```

#### Step 6: Calculate Cost Per Placement
Determine value of a single 30-second ad placement

```
Cost Per Placement = (Premium CPM ÷ 1000) × Total Views
Example: ($204.75 ÷ 1000) × 50,000 = $10,237.50 per placement
```

#### Step 7: Calculate Maximum Possible Placements
Ensure ads don't exceed 30% of total stream time

```
Max Ad Time = Stream Length × 0.30
Max Placements = Max Ad Time ÷ 0.5 minutes (30 seconds)
Example: 180 minutes × 0.30 = 54 minutes
         54 ÷ 0.5 = 108 maximum placements possible
```

#### Step 8: Calculate Total Inventory Value
Determine total value based on selected ad frequency

```
Total Inventory Value = Cost Per Placement × Selected Frequency
Example: $10,237.50 × 4 placements = $40,950
```

### Multiple Brand Placements

The calculator supports multiple brands purchasing ad slots in the same stream:

**Example Scenario (20-minute stream):**
- Maximum ad time: 20 × 0.30 = 6 minutes
- Brand A: Buys 4 placements (2 minutes) = $X
- Brand B: Buys 4 placements (2 minutes) = $X
- Brand C: Buys 4 placements (2 minutes) = $X
- **Total: 12 placements (6 minutes) = 3 brands sharing inventory**

Each brand gets guaranteed exposure without exceeding the 30% threshold.
